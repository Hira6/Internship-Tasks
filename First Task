🌟 Excited to share my first task as a UX/UI Design Intern at @HunarIntern 🌟

I was tasked with designing a visually appealing and user-friendly sign-up form page for a fictional website/application. Here are the project details:

🔹𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: To create an intuitive and engaging sign-up form suitable for adults aged 25-40.

🔹𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗘𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:
 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐞: Reflects the brand with good contrast for readability.
 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐭: Clean and organized single-column design.
 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐅𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝𝐬:Full Name, Email Address, Password, Confirm Password, and Mobile Number.
 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: Icons for each field, subtle background pattern, and an attractive "Sign Up" button with hover feedback.
 𝐄𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Clear and user-friendly error messages.
 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲:Considered principles like sufficient color contrast and readable text.

𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐦𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐰:
𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐅𝐢𝐠𝐦𝐚: Inserted image of the entire sign-up form page here
𝐁𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐧 𝐇𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Inserted image showing the "Sign Up" button turning purple when hovered over.

I’m thrilled with how it turned out and look forward to more learning and growth in this journey.
